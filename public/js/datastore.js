            "Malbec, Merlot, and Zinfandel are my top picks for Cheeseburger. Merlot will be perfectly adequate for a classic burger with standard toppings. Bolder toppings call for bolder wines, such as a malbec or peppery zinfandel. One wine you could try is Ernesto Catena Padrillos Malbec. It has 4.8 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 15 dollars.",
